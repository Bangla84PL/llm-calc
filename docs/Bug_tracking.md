## Resolution Workflow

### 1. Issue Identification
- Issue is identified through testing, user reports, or monitoring
- Issue is logged using the template above
- Priority is assigned based on impact and urgency

### 2. Investigation
- Developer investigates and documents root cause
- Solution approach is documented
- Time estimate for fix is provided

### 3. Implementation
- Fix is implemented following coding standards
- Code review is conducted
- Unit tests are added/updated as needed

### 4. Testing
- Fix is tested in development environment
- Regression testing is performed
- User acceptance testing if needed

### 5. Deployment
- Fix is deployed to production
- Monitoring is in place to verify resolution
- Issue status is updated to "Resolved"

### 6. Verification
- Issue is verified as fixed in production
- Follow-up monitoring for any side effects
- Issue status is updated to "Closed"

## Common Issue Categories and Prevention

### Calculator Logic Issues
**Prevention Strategies:**
- Comprehensive unit testing of calculation functions
- Edge case testing (extreme values, invalid inputs)
- Cross-validation with external tools/calculators

**Common Root Causes:**
- Floating point arithmetic precision
- Incorrect conversion factors
- Missing validation for edge cases

### UI/UX Issues
**Prevention Strategies:**
- Cross-browser testing
- Responsive design testing on multiple devices
- Accessibility testing with screen readers

**Common Root Causes:**
- CSS compatibility issues
- Improper responsive breakpoints
- Missing accessibility attributes

### Performance Issues
**Prevention Strategies:**
- Performance monitoring and profiling
- Bundle size optimization
- Lazy loading implementation

**Common Root Causes:**
- Large bundle sizes
- Inefficient React re-renders
- Unoptimized images or assets

### Data Issues
**Prevention Strategies:**
- Data validation and schema enforcement
- Regular data accuracy audits
- Automated data integrity checks

**Common Root Causes:**
- Outdated pricing information
- Incorrect hardware specifications
- Missing model data

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Error Tracking
- Implement error boundary components
- Set up client-side error logging
- Monitor Core Web Vitals and performance metrics

### User Feedback
- Provide feedback mechanism for users
- Monitor user behavior analytics
- Regular user testing sessions

### Automated Testing
- Continuous integration testing
- Visual regression testing
- Accessibility testing automation

## Emergency Response Procedures

### Production Outage (P0)
1. **Immediate Response** (0-15 minutes)
   - Acknowledge the incident
   - Assess impact and severity
   - Implement immediate mitigation if possible

2. **Investigation** (15-60 minutes)
   - Identify root cause
   - Document findings
   - Develop fix or rollback plan

3. **Resolution** (1-4 hours)
   - Implement fix or rollback
   - Verify resolution
   - Monitor for stability

4. **Post-Incident** (24-48 hours)
   - Conduct post-mortem
   - Document lessons learned
   - Implement preventive measures

### High Priority Bug (P1)
1. **Acknowledgment** (2-4 hours)
2. **Investigation** (1-2 days)
3. **Fix Implementation** (2-5 days)
4. **Testing and Deployment** (1-2 days)
